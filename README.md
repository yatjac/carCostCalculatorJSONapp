# carCostCalculatorJSONapp
This car cost calculator uses .json with Google Firebase Cloud Database. It is coded with JavaScript in Android Studio. (the current BASE_URL has a url that is no longer an active database. a new firebase database would need to be created in order to input a new URL into the BASE_URL for the code to work correctly.)
